Hi, my name is Josh and I'm a full stack developer with a preference for backend
and devops work. I'm currently employed by MongoDB in New York. I studied
computer science at Rutgers University from 2011-2015, during which time I
also participated in the computer science club and worked on campus at Open
System Solutions. I can be contacted at
<a id="aboutAddr" href="#">josh@{thisDomain}</a>.
If you want to send me PGP mail, my public key can be found on
[keybase](https://keybase.io/jmatth).

<script type="application/javascript">
(function() {
  var addr = atob('am9zaEBqbWF0dGguY29t');
  var block = document.getElementById('aboutAddr');
  block.setAttribute(
    'href',
    'mailto:' + addr);
  block.innerHTML = block.innerHTML.replace(
    'josh@{thisDomain}',
    addr);
})();
</script>
