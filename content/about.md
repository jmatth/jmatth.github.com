Hi, my name is Josh and I'm a full stack developer with a preference for backend
and devops work. I'm currently working on a project to help modernize the technology
in my favorite hobby, tabletop RPGs. You can read about it at [bringingfire.com][1].

In the past I've been employed at MongoDB, where I worked on the Atlas cloud service.

I studied computer science at Rutgers University from 2011-2015, during which time I
also participated in the computer science club and worked on campus at Open
System Solutions.

I can be contacted at [josh@jmatth.com][2].
If you want to send me PGP mail, my public key can be found on
[keybase][3].
