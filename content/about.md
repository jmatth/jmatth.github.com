Hi, my name is Josh and I'm a full stack developer with a preference for backend
and devops work. I'm currently employed by MongoDB in New York. I studied
computer science at Rutgers University from 2011 - 2015, during which time I
also participated in the computer science club and worked on campus at Open
System Solutions.
