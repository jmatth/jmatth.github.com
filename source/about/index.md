Hi, my name is Josh Matthews, and I am a sophomore currently studying computer science at [Rutgers University](http://rutgers.edu).

I am a software developer currently employed at [Open System Solutions](http://oss.rutgers.edu), where I have worked on a variety of projects ranging from web design and development to systems programming.
I have also done several independent projects at a number of hackathons.

Listed below are a few of the projects I have worked on, with links to the code where available, and my full résumé is available [here](/resume.pdf).

- [Movies4L8tr](http://github.com/jmatth/Movies4L8tr) -- A hackathon project at the Fall 2012 HackRu. It is a simple website built using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/). It finds upcoming movies using the Rotten Tomatoes API, and allows users to sign up to recieve reminders when the movies are released via either email (via Sendgrid) or text (via Twillio). The backend uses MongoDB to store the user data, and it won best MongoDB hack.

- [Trollnet](http://github.com/jmatth/trollnet) -- This hackathon project won second place at HackNY in Fall2012. It uses several open source programs running on a [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) to create a wifi access point that modifies the images for anyone using it to access the internet.

- [2P Breakout](http://github.com/jmatth/2p_breakout) -- My first non-trivial program, this is a simple java game written my first semester for a seminar in computer science. Two players use different sides of the keyboard to control paddles in the left and right of the board and try to destroy all the blocks in the center. Each player can only destroy blocks that match the color of their paddle. The image used for the ball and winning graphic are pictures of the class instructor.
