Hi, my name is Josh Matthews, and I am a sophomore studying computer science at
[Rutgers University](http://rutgers.edu).

I am a currently employed as a student systems programmer at
[Open System Solutions](http://oss.rutgers.edu), where I have worked on a
variety of projects ranging from web design and development to systems
programming.  I have also done several independent projects at a number of
hackathons.

Listed below are a few of the projects I have worked on, with links to the code
where available, and my full résumé is available [here](/resume.pdf).

- [EzPrompt](http://github.com/jmatth/ezprompt) (live version online at
  [ezprompt.net](http://ezprompt.net)) -- a personal project I worked on during
  downtime in February 2013, this is an easy to use webapp that helps new Linux
  users customize their Bash prompt configuration with useful information.
  Besides HTML and CSS for the markup and styling, everything is written in
  JavaScript with [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/) and the jQuery plugin
  [Spectrum](http://bgrins.github.com/spectrum/).

- [Movies4L8tr](http://github.com/jmatth/Movies4L8tr) -- A hackathon project at
  the Fall 2012 HackRu. It is a simple website built using
  [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and
  [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/). It finds upcoming
  movies using the Rotten Tomatoes API, and allows users to sign up to receive
  reminders when the movies are released via either email (via Sendgrid) or
  text (via Twillio). The backend uses MongoDB to store the user data, and it
  won best MongoDB hack.

- [Trollnet](http://github.com/jmatth/trollnet) -- This hackathon project won
  second place at HackNY in Fall2012. It uses several open source programs
  running on a [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) to create a wifi
  access point that modifies the images for anyone using it to access the
  internet.

- [2P Breakout](http://github.com/jmatth/2p_breakout) -- My first non-trivial
  program, this is a simple java game written my first semester for a seminar
  in computer science. Two players use different sides of the keyboard to
  control paddles in the left and right of the board and try to destroy all the
  blocks in the center. Each player can only destroy blocks that match the
  color of their paddle. The image used for the ball and winning graphic are
  pictures of the class instructor.
