      <description>Hi, my name is Josh and I&amp;rsquo;m a full stack developer with a preference for backend and devops work. I&amp;rsquo;m currently employed by MongoDB in New York. I studied computer science at Rutgers University from 2011-2015, during which time I also participated in the computer science club and worked on campus at Open System Solutions. I can be contacted at josh@{thisDomain}. If you want to send me PGP mail, my public key can be found on keybase.</description>
